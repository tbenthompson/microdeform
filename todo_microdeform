figure out why the code didn't work and run it more
--maybe the problem is too nonlinear n it found a very local max, should i do some sort of random start
--try lower nearestCount to speed things
--try less features -- only the doubly matched ones?

also try a sparsity method
--count the number of deviations from the best value

look at some sort of "isolation" metric
