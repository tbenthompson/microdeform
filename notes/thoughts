alternate ways of doing the points detection:
--see various particle tracking codes online and see how they do their tracking == http://physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/tutorial.html
--maybe some sort of fourier transform and then statistical chi squared test with the distribution expected from a training set and then smoothly move the kernel over the image, could be pretty slow...
